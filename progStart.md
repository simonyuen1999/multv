## What are the diferent between lazy loading and dynamic loading?

**Lazy** and **dynamic** loading are two different strategies for loading components or modules.

### Lazy Loading

- Lazy loading is a design pattern that loads `NgModules` as needed, which helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller and decrease load times.
- By default, `NgModules` are eagerly loaded, meaning they load as soon as the application loads, whether they are immediately necessary or not.
- To lazy load Angular modules, use `loadChildren (instead of component)` in your `AppRoutingModule` routes configuration.
- Lazy loading is beneficial for large applications with lots of routes.

### Dynamic Loading

- Dynamic loading refers to the behavior of loading components conditionally on the website.
- For example, when a user clicks a modal-button, the code for the modal is loaded. This is dynamic behavior.
- It can also be said that the modal was lazily-loaded when the user clicked the button, hence there can be an overlap between dynamic and lazy loading in certain scenarios.

It’s important to note that these strategies can be used together in a single application to optimize performance and user experience. For instance, Angular 17 introduced a new **defer** block that lets you lazy load content based on specific conditions or events.

## Can that dynamic loading component be built and replaced by separated build process and bundle?

In Angular, **dynamic loading** is a technique that allows you to load components conditionally or on-demand. This can be particularly useful for improving performance in large applications, as it allows you to load only the components that are needed at a given time.

Here’s a simple example of how dynamic loading might work in an Angular application:

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-ad-banner',
  template: `
    <div class="ad-banner-example">
      <h3>Advertisements</h3>
      <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="currentAd.component; inputs: currentAd.inputs;"></ng-container>
      <button (click)="displayNextAd()">Next</button>
    </div>
  `
})
export class AdBannerComponent {
  // ... omitted for brevity
}
```

In this example, the `ngComponentOutlet` directive is used to dynamically load different ad components.

As for your second question, yes, it is possible to build and replace a dynamically loaded component with a separate build process and bundle. This can be achieved using `webpack` or the Angular CLI, which allow you to split your application into separate bundles. Each component or module can then be loaded individually, further improving performance.

However, it’s important to note that this process can be complex and requires careful configuration. You’ll need to ensure that your build process is set up correctly to create separate bundles for each component or module, and you’ll also need to handle the dynamic import statements in your Angular application.

## Show me how to use Angular CLI to split the app into separate build and bundle.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use Angular CLI to split your application into separate builds and bundles:

1. **Generate multiple Angular applications**: You can create multiple applications within the same project using the Angular CLI command `ng generate application <project-name>`.
```
ng generate application app1
ng generate application app2
```

2. **Build and serve them separately**: Each application can be built and served separately using the commands `ng build <project-name>` and `ng serve <project-name>`.
```
ng build app1
ng serve app1

ng build app2
ng serve app2
```

3. **Modify your** `angular.json` **file**: You need to add a name property to each element in the `apps` array in your `angular.json` file. Here’s an example:

```js
"apps": [
  {
    "name": "app1",
    "root": "src/app1root",
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "app2",
    "root": "src/app2root",
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

4. **Build all apps at the same time**: If you want to build all your apps at the same time, you can add a script to your `package.json` file:

```js
"scripts": {
  "build-projects": "ng build app1 && ng build app2",
}
```

Then, you can run the script with the command `npm run build-projects`
```
npm run build-projects
```

5. **Split common and vendor chunks**: You can also split common and vendor chunks using Angular CLI options. You can add these settings to your project’s `angular.json` file or use them directly with the `ng build` command3.

```
ng build --commonChunk --vendorChunk
```

Please note that this is a high-level overview and the exact steps may vary depending on your specific use case and the structure of your Angular project. Always make sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure that everything is working as expected.

## Show me how to use webpack to split the app into separate build and bundle.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use webpack to split your application into separate builds and bundles:

1. **Define multiple entry points**: In your webpack configuration file (usually `webpack.config.js`), you can define multiple entry points for different parts of your application.

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    main: "./path/to/main.js",
    vendor: "./path/to/vendor.js"
  },
  output: {
    filename: "[name].bundle.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
  }
};
```

In this example, `main` and `vendor` are two separate entry points. **Webpack** will create a separate bundle for each1.

2. **Use the SplitChunksPlugin**: Webpack includes a built-in optimization feature called SplitChunksPlugin that can automatically split your code into separate bundles.

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
    },
  },
};
```

In this configuration, webpack will automatically split all your code into separate bundles.

3. **Dynamic Imports**: You can also use dynamic `import()` syntax to split your code. When webpack comes across this syntax, it automatically starts code-splitting.

```js
import(/* webpackChunkName: "lodash" */ 'lodash').then(({ default: _ }) => {
  // Use lodash
});
```
In this example, lodash will be split into a separate chunk that is loaded only when the function is called.

Please note that this is a high-level overview and the exact steps may vary depending on your specific use case and the structure of your project. Always make sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure that everything is working as expected.

## Can Angular import another component or module from website?  From the above example, can the import statement work on the browser?

Angular (SPAs) can import other components or modules from the website. This is a common practice in modular Angular applications.

In Angular, you can use the `import` statement to import components, services, or modules from other files or modules. This is part of the **ES6** module system that Angular uses.

However, it’s important to note that the `import` statement is not natively supported in all browsers. Therefore, Angular applications are usually transpiled using tools like `Babel` or `TypeScript`, and bundled using module bundlers like `Webpack`. These tools transform the `import` statements into code that can be executed in the browser.

In Angular 17’s standalone mode, you can organize your application without a central module file. Instead, you can import the necessary modules directly into the components where they are needed. Each import statement brings in the necessary module for the component.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77727305/in-standalone-mode-how-to-i-import-a-module-in-angular-17

Here’s an example of how you might import a module directly into a component:

```js
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';
import { MatTabsModule } from '@angular/material/tabs';
import { MatRadioModule } from '@angular/material/radio';
import { ReactiveFormsModule, FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-demo',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    MatMenuModule,
    MatTabsModule,
    MatRadioModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    FormsModule
  ],
  templateUrl: './demo.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./demo.component.scss']
})
export class DemoComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() {}
  ngOnInit(): void {}
}
```

In this case, you don’t need a central `app.module.ts` file. The component itself specifies its dependencies using the `imports` property of the `@Component decorator`.
